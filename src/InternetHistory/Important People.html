                        <h5>
                            Not everyone is talented or lucky enough to become a movie star or musician or have mass
                            mainstream media followings. These people that were movie stars, musicians, famous
                            celebrities had thousands of dollars of equipment following them and capturing their daily
                            life. Some of these people also controlled what the average person would watch on
                            Television. “Everyone has the opportunity and should have the opportunity to be heard”
                            expresses YouTube CEO, Chad Hurley. In this ecosystem of YouTube everyone had the
                            opportunity to share videos of themselves to millions of people who used the Internet. This
                            was just one of the beginnings of the new form of online media sharing.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Then came Napster. An online peer to peer network that allowed users to share music. Fanny,
                            the founder of Napster thought of this idea out of the necessity of trying to find music on
                            the internet and getting frustrated constantly. Napster soon had millions of downloads
                            making it one of the fastest growing applications on the Internet. With the sudden rise to
                            fame, Napster found itself in legal issues. Records labels and lawyers saw how Napster was
                            distributing copyrighted material for free within their network and were loosing revenue
                            from sales due to it. Bands and artists such as Metallica and Dre, despised Napster for
                            distributing their music online for free. Soon this escalated to the court room and Napster
                            was told that it had to shut down.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Tech giant, Steve Jobs from Apple, took this idea of music sharing and made it legal by
                            having to pay for music to be downloaded to devices and be copyrighted at the same time.
                            Record labels loved this. However, YouTube found itself in the same situation as Napster and
                            record labels and copyrighted material owner were starting to take notice once again.

                        <h5>
                            The term Web 2.0 came about during this time of YouTube and Napster and was defined as user
                            generated content. User generated content brought the rise of Myspace. A website where
                            anyone can create a profile for anyone to see. Millions of people had a Myspace account and
                            soon took over google in search results. Another website also rose to popularity during this
                            time called Facebook. Like most startups, this company was also started by a college student
                            in their dorm then having to move to Silicon Valley and then becoming filthy rich. Now there
                            were two tech giants in this Web 2.0 era. Facebook becoming the long term victor.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Not everyone was about making millions on the web. In fact, the founder of Craigslist and
                            Wikipedia offer their service for free online. Ultimately the Web, became a place for
                            sharing and the new form of communication that everyone used.
