                            Rise of Browsers
                        </h3>
                        <h5>
                            In the early days of the World Wide Web, using the Internet was limited to those who knew
                            how to use it. Being able to surf the World Wide Web with ease was the goal of Mark
                            Andreessen, a University of Illinois Computer Science student. “He imagined a future were
                            everyone including regular people, could use the web as part of our regular lives”. Mark,
                            was the inventor of the first graphical web browser, Mosaic. Within months he had millions
                            of regular people that downloaded his browser and who were using it. When Jim Clark, a very
                            wealthy business man from silicon valley, found out about how many users this browser had,
                            he sent Mark a business opportunity. Mark, being a Junior in college, was astounded from the
                            offer for a full time position and became business partners with Jim Clark under Netscape
                            Communications. The only thing between Jim and Mark and mass fortune were business rivals
                            Microsoft. At the time Microsoft had virtually a monopoly on computer operating systems.
                            Bill Gates, the owner of Microsoft and Harvard dropout, were stopping and destroying small
                            tech startups that were trying to overthrow them from their monopoly.

                        <h5>
                            When Netscape released their new web browser, Navigator, it got over 1 millions downloads
                            and got the attention of many important people, specifically Bill Gates. The massive amount
                            of downloads that Navigator was getting made him realize that web browsers are the next big
                            thing and Gates would try to destroy anyone from becoming more powerful than him, starting
                            the browser wars. Bill Gates wanting to take the easy victory and offered Netscape
                            communications 1 millions dollars for their company. However, since Netscape had a well
                            known Anti-trust Lawyer with them, legal actions was to be taken against Microsoft. At some
                            point, Netscape Communication went public and had and IPO. Its IPO went crazy and made the
                            owners of Netscape richer than they already were. At this point the people at Netscape felt
                            invincible and started downplaying Microsoft, the giants in technology at the time.
                            Microsoft just about had enough from Netscape and released their own internet browser called
                            Internet Explorer. Within a few months, Netscape shares plummeted and soon ceased to exist.
                            However, it wasn’t the end of the war for Microsoft as they now faced the federal US
                            government. Being found guilty of breaking anti trust laws, Gates had to split Microsoft up,
                            but before an appeal was made. Many people saw this as Microsoft getting away with murder
                            but the damage had already been done and Netscape was no more. The ultimate victor of the
                            browser wars- Microsoft.
