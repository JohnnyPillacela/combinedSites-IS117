                        <h5>
                            There was a time when searching stuff on the Internet wasn’t as easy as just going on Google
                            and getting millions of results in seconds. It has to be created and it these tech startups
                            that were creating these search engines had to get funding and some way to make money. When
                            venture capitalists saw how to make money on the Internet, they went to Jerry Yang and David
                            Filo, the co-founders of Yahoo. Jerry and David wanted to advertise on their search engine
                            to millions of their users, but were very skeptical at the time as they thought they would
                            receive a lot of backlash from their users. However, once advertisements were put in place,
                            Yahoo made millions, and no one seemed to care about ads, which spawned many competitors in
                            the search engine game.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            After a while, these search engines became very entangled and obsessed with the idea of
                            making money and forgot their initial intention of providing meaningful and useful search
                            results to their users. Excite and Google soon become another search engine looking to
                            become the most used search engine on the Internet. Google’s take on their search engine
                            provided a raking system that kept track of how many times a link was clicked on and would
                            show the most clicked link at the top of a search result. One of Excite’s executives saw how
                            vastly better the google search engine was compared to theirs that they wanted to google
                            merge with Excite to take down one of their competitors, Yahoo. No deal was able to be made
                            as Excite couldn’t find a way to profit from search engines like google which only ranked
                            clicks on websites.

                        <h5>
                            When a professor at Stanford University saw the opportunity with Google, he introduced them
                            to a wealthy friend of his that would be able to fund Google. Shortly after that, Google was
                            flooded with funds. Google running out of ideas of how to make money needed another source
                            of income. In a meeting with Idealabs CEO, the google founders stole Idealabs idea of paid
                            advertising for links next to the actual results of links and keys that could be sold to
                            advertisers. Idealabs took Google to court for stealing their idea and settled it there for
                            a relatively small price. Ultimately, Google was now making even more money than ever before
                            and decide to take their company public. Shortly after the IPO, the google founders quickly
                            become the worlds richest people. Not stopping and always looking for a way to make more
                            money, Google created many more services that people could use and bought out many other
                            companies that could benefit Google in the long.
