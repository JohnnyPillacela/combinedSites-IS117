                            “The Internet is the next big thing. Its on par with the wheel, fire, language, the printing
                            press” begins
                            this documentary from the History Channel talking about how the Internet is just as
                            important
                            and
                            revolutionary as the wheel or the printing press. There is no doubt that the Internet has
                            been a
                            revolutionary invention, but how did it begin? To begin with, we will start with computers
                            since
                            they are
                            the objects needed to access the Internet. During the Space war, the US government noticed
                            how
                            the Soviet
                            Union was advancing quicker than them to space. Due to the US government not wanting to fall
                            behind in space
                            exploration, President Eisenhower created a Bureau at the Defense department called the
                            Advance
                            Research
                            Projects Agency, mainly known as ARPA. ARPA would take care of space exploration and
                            computer
                            science
                            research. Soon NASA took over and left computer research behind.

                            The Continuation
                        </h3>
                        <h5>
                            In the earliest form of
                            computers,
                            computers could take up the space of an entire room. There were also very few of these
                            computers
                            since they
                            were expensive and costly to maintain. As time went on, millions of dollars went into
                            research
                            of computers
                            and networks. One notable form of network or communication that came from this would be that
                            no
                            matter if a
                            line of communication between two computers was cut, there would be vast other options for
                            the
                            data to get
                            from computer A to computer B. At some point many institutions were creating their own
                            computers
                            that
                            contained their own protocols and if anyone else wanted to connect to them they would have
                            to
                            follow their
                            same protocol. This wasn’t very efficient as now every computer had to be programmed the
                            protocol of another
                            computer before connecting to it and wasn’t very scalable. The creation of the ARPAnet was
                            the
                            answer to
                            this problem, also known as the ARPA network. The ARPAnet connected all computers in its
                            network
                            to each
                            other making scalability possible. However, using the ARPAnet was very esoteric and not many
                            people knew how
                            to use it. A couple years later, Tim Berners Lee, created the World Wide Web allowing
                            regular
                            people to
                            connect to the ARPAnet. This was when the Internet as we know it today took off.
