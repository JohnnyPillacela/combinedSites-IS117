                        <h5>
                            “The Internet is a network of networks. It links billions of devices together all around the
                            globe” says one of the co-founders of the Internet, Vincent. When we connect to our Wi-Fi,
                            our Internet Service provider then connects us to the rest of the computers on the network
                            that are interconnected. An IP Address is a unique number assigned to each device on the
                            network. It is what allows other devices connected on the network to send information to
                            your device. However, all devices on the network have to follow the same protocol, which in
                            this case is the Internet Protocol. Hence, “a computers address is called an IP address”
                            says Vincent. If a computer connected to the internet, visits a website, then it is just
                            sending a message to the other computer with its IP address attached so the other computer
                            can know where to send the information back to. An IP address can be related to someone’s
                            physical address in the sense that the IP address is like someone’s house address. In order
                            for a mail carrier to deliver a package or letter correctly everyone must follow the same
                            protocol, or in other terms the same style for writing addresses. IP addresses are written
                            in such a way that there are 4 numbers each separated by a period. Each of these numbers
                            represent something different and hold 8 bits of information each. This means that an IP
                            address holds 32 bits of information. An example of an IP address would be “123.456.78.90”.
                            The first set of numbers identify the country of the device. The second set of numbers
                            identify the region of the device. The third set of numbers identify the subnetwork and
                            finally the last set of numbers identify the specific device. However, most numbers these
                            days don’t specify countries they just specify networks and subnetworks as a whole, but are
                            still put in 4 different sets. Since there are 4 different sets of numbers, this is called
                            IPv4 and was designed in 1973 and used everywhere by the 1980’s. IPv4 also provides almost 4
                            billion unique IP addresses to devices connected on the internet.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            There is a big problem though. At some point there will be need for more unique IP address
                            but there won’t be enough unique addresses remaining. IPv6 is currently being worked on
                            which uses 128 bits per address and provides 340 undecillion unique IP addresses.

                            The way information gets sent over the Internet isn’t as straightforward as sending a
                            request to a server and getting information back. As information gets sent over the internet
                            to its destination it can take various paths, always trying to find the faster route. Also
                            the information that gets sent over the internet travels as a packet of information. These
                            packets hold pieces of information from the original data or information that is being sent
                            over the Internet. Once all these packets arrive at the destination, they merge together to
                            form the original data.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            Routers keep track of all the routes for sending packets over the internet. It also chooses
                            the cheapest path for each packet to travel on. In the case where some packets get lost or a
                            router stops working, then there are other paths which the packets can take to reach the
                            destination.
                        </h5>
                        <h5>
                            To make sure all the packets are delivered correctly, they follow the Transmission Control
                            Protocol, or TCP. TCP is in charge of making sure all packets have been delivered and if it
                            notices that some packets are missing then the original sender will resend packets. The more
                            routers that are added to the network the better the network becomes.
